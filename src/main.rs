///    We need to keep additional data in memory to construct this from partial
///    responses.
/// 2. A vector of thermostat readings. This is kept in cache to allow the
///    weather virtual thermostat to be pushed to the collection independently
///    of Ecobee thermostat readings.
/// 3. A daily weather forecast. Because we only query this at most once a day,

/// This utilizes the lazy_static crate to enable a simpler syntax for creating
/// static variables that require runtime initialization, for example calling

/// A backend system to bring my Ecobee thermostat readings together. Also,
/// my first Rust project.
/// 
/// It implements a background worker thread that retrieves data from remote
/// API's and stores them in a database. It also runs an HTTP server for 
/// getting that data back. It utilizes some global static variables for
/// moving data from the background thread to the main thread, for faster
/// response times. 
/// 
/// I believe this is a good starter project because it covers a breadth of
/// topics, from thread management, to ownership/borrowing, hyper HTTP server,
/// serializing/deserializing structured data, etc.
/// 
/// Crates Used:
/// 1. Lazy Static - for initializing complex types as statics.
/// 2. Serde - for turning objects into JSON and vice versa.
/// 3. Diesel - for storing data in the database and retrieving it.
/// 4. Hyper - for HTTP server implementation.
/// 5. Chrono - for date and time operations.
